\item{\textbf{processes of ranking}}

Actually, there are 4 missions for the whole championship, and every mission has different rules and penalties, but the processes of every mission works similarly, when a team finished an attempt, we should create a score for this attempt, from the algorithm we used, we could get the time cost or a raw score differed from missions. Here I take an example of triangular course to illustrate the process to obtain the best score, where Hi means human intervention:
