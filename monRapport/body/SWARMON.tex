\subsection{History Project SWARMON}
The tracking system and website made to follow the boats have been first developped through the project SWARMON from 2013 to 2014. This project was realised by ENSTA Bretagne's students Quentin DESCOURS, Benoit BOURDON, Jean-Jacques BOYE, Simon STEPHAN and the responsible teacher Olivier REYNET. 

The project was improved during summer 2014 by Bastien DROUOT and Benoit BOURDON in the Åland University of Applied Sciences, under the direction of Ronny ERIKSSON, vice rector of the University. It was used successfully for the WRSC 2014 in Galway (Ireland).

Then he tracker and the website were again enhanced by Quentin DESCOURS, Benoit BOURDON and Bastien DROUOT during their third year at ENSTA Bretage from 2014 to 2015.

Finally, the actual version is meant for the WRSC of 2015 that happened in Mariehamn in Åland (Finland). It was built up by Tao ZHENG and Sylvain Hunault, students from the ENSTA Bretagne, thanks to the help of the predecessors and under the guidance of Anna FRIEBE, Project Manager at Åland University of Applied Sciences, during summer 2015 in Mariehamn.
