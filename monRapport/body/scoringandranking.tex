\subsubsection{Auto Scoring and Ranking}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Scoring}


The WRSC contains 4 missions: Station Keeping, Area Scanning, Triangular Course and Fleet Race. And I was in charge of the scoring for Station Keeping and Area Scanning. So I will introduce the algorithms I had chosen to calculate the score.
\begin{itemize}
\input{stationkeeping}
\input{areascanning}
\end{itemize} 
\item{Ranking}
\begin{itemize}
\input{improvedmodel}
\input{processesofranking}
\end{itemize}
