\item{Improved Model}
The previous version do not contain the function of scoring and ranking, so the old model do not satisfy the new need. Then we proposed a new model, the principle is every attempt has a unique score, every robot has many attempts, equally every robot has many scores, then we just need to take the best score into account for every robot, at last we compare all the scores for all the robots. So we add a new table Score into the model and add some new attributes to the table Robot.
