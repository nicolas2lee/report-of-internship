\item{Description of mission}
As the WRSC rules described, the objective of the station keeping contest is to evaluate controlled sailing in a limited region with time constraints. Each boat must start outside a 45 m x 45 m box, marked by four buoys. In the team slot time, the boat must enter the box. The boat shall leave the box at a time as close as possible to 5 minutes after entering the box. Boats fulfilling the entry and exit criteria are awarded points based on the following formula:
P = max (0, 10 - |Tenter + 300 - Tleave|/10)
Where: Tenter is the timestamp when the boat first enters the box and Tleave is the timestamp
when the boat first leaves the box. If the boat enters and leaves the box several times, any leave timestamps within ten seconds from Tenter are ignored. All timestamps are given in seconds.
