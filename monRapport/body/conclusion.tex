\section{Conclusion}
Based on a ruby on rails framework, with jQuery libraries, building up a web server is not simple as what we see. In order to make a good product, we need to familiar with font end design technologies(html, CSS). And then JavaScript, Ajax are two indispensable tools for web developers. In addition, script programming, knowledge of database and network, all of them are the basic elements to construct the final building. A full stack engineer is not only an expert in one domain, but also should be familiar with different fields, then capable to suit in different environment and capable to work under pressure. This internship not only allow me to learn much more scientific technologies, but also a good experience to be a responsible engineer.
